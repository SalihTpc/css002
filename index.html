        <h1>Neşet Ertaş</h1>
        <p>
          Neşet Ertaş (1938 – 25 September 2012) was a Turkish folk music
          singer, lyricist, modern ashik and virtuoso of the traditional Turkish
          instrument the bağlama. His profession in Turkish is known as halk
          ozanı, which literally means "folk bard". Yaşar Kemal gave Ertaş his
          nickname, "Bozkırın Tezenesi" (literally: "Plectrum of the Steppe"),
          writing it in a book he gave him as a gift. <br />
          At the age of five and six, Neşet Ertaş started to play first the
          violin and then the bağlama, the Turkish national instrument. His
          father earned his living by playing at wedding ceremonies in Central
          Anatolian villages, and for eight years Neşet accompanied him. As a
          result, he was not able to finish primary school. At the age of
          fourteen, Neşet Ertaş went to Istanbul, where he played at a night
          club in Beyoğlu. After two years, he moved to Ankara to continue his
          stage career there. He applied to the state-owned Turkish Radio (TRT)
          station in Ankara and began performing türkü, Turkish folk songs, on a
          daytime programme called Yurttan Sesler (literally: "Sounds from the
          Homeland") under the name "Neşet Ertaş of Kırşehir". At the same time,
          he played in night clubs at night. He became very popular and gave
          concerts in many cities, in some cases six or seven times. His
          compositions and recordings made him renowned. But then in 1978, his
          fingers became paralysed. He soon became penniless and had no means of
          paying for treatment, since he had no other marketable skills. So in
          1979 he went to Germany, where his brother was living. There, he
          recovered from his paralysis, and started again to perform music at
          wedding ceremonies and local events attended by members of the Turkish
          community in Germany. He also took his three children there. A German
          school of arts offered him a teaching post for saz playing. He
          accepted and served for two years in this position. During his time in
          Germany, Ertaş dedicated himself to his children's education, and he
          was almost forgotten in his country. However, pirates continued to
          profit from playing his music and lyrics in Turkey. In the beginning
          of 2000, he protested openly against the TRT, which had stated that he
          was dead. After 23 years, he returned home and was welcomed by crowds.
          The audience at his first concert, which took place at the Harbiye
          Open-Air Theatre in Istanbul, gave him a standing ovation to his great
          surprise, a great success after 30 years of absence. This was followed
          by tours around the country and free concerts. He experienced again
          the pleasure of meeting the people of his homeland. However, he
          rejected the title of "State Artist" which the Turkish state wanted to
          award him, saying, "I am already an artist of this state." Ertaş's
          first record was released in 1957. During his career, he recorded more
          than 30 albums. It is claimed that due to flawed copyright laws in
          Turkey, he did not fully benefit from his poems, music and audio
          recordings. He interpreted musical pieces of the Abdal-Turkoman
          tradition, following his father. With his forceful baglama, his warm
          voice and his pure and simple language, Neşet Ertaş gathered the
          people of Central Anatolia first, and then the entire country.
